# Details  

- *(See video link at top of README, email jcorso1@lsu.edu if having troubles accessing)*
- Had issues with previous projects
- These issues compacted, making subsequent projects more difficult
- Culminated in spending more time fixing previous issues than working on the actual project
  - See video for more details :)
- Error below with our Grm.cup file that made us pivot to studying for the exam
  - We were unable to fix the issues with recompiling this file, so we were unable to debug our actual codebase further

### Error that shed tears
